beliefstate
===

The beliefstate package supplies a ROS driven system with recording capabilities on low (sensor messages), and on high (symbolic) data level. Its sole idea is to keep track of the contexts in which a high level plan execution system performs actions, record its parameters, and give a detailed output about what happened during execution.

Due to popular demand, the project was moved to a different repository:

https://github.com/code-iai/ros-semrec
